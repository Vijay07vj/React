//React.createElement => Object => HTML Element(render)

//JSX - is not HTML inside javascript/ HTML/XML like syntax.

//JSX (Transpiled(converted) before it reaches the JS Engine).

//Transpling is done by PARCEL - it is done by BABEL.

//JSX => React.creatElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render).

//React Component
//class based component - old way of writing code(no body is using it now)
//functional component - new version of codes.
